Iâ€™m Jake, a programmer. I work with a handful of languages including Java, C#, and Objective-C. I am part of the [Cortex Modders](http://github.com/cortex-modders/) who makes [Minecraft mods](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mods). Sometimes I make mods on my own (e.g [RankCapes](/RankCapes/)). I also [blog](/index.html) about interesting stuff I find while going about programming.  
  
In addition, I'm also part of [TheGameGeeks](http://www.thegamegeeks.net/), who post [videos](http://www.youtube.com/Th3GameGeeks) and run a [Minecraft server](http://www.thegamegeeks.net/server/).  
  
One day I'll get [Jadar Studios](http://www.jadarstudios.com/) off the ground and release a few games and various other pieces of software.  
  
See [Projects](/projects.html) for all my major projects. Also see my personal [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/jadardev) which I occasionally upload to.
