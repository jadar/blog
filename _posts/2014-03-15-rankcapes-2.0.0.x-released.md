title: RankCapes 2.0.0.* Released
---

The first official RankCapes version has been released! I know it's version 2, but that's because there was a version for Minecraft 1.6.4 that was mostly complete and released, which I think of as version 1. Currently it's pending on [BukkitDev](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/rankcapes/) and should be up shortly. Recommended builds are [here](/RankCapes/downloads.html).
