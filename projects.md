###Minecraft - [RankCapes](/RankCapes/)

RankCapes was made for servers that would like to offer something more to their players. Originally dubbed “DonorCapes”, I made an experimental version that was rather sketchy and not very flexible. Now I have coded from the ground up a brand new version that is a fun aesthetic mod that allows servers to give their players capes based on permissions given to them. RankCapes is not restricted to donating or contributing players, though; anyone can be given a cape, as anyone can be given a permission. Easy to use, RankCapes implements Cape Packs that are like Resource Packs and can be swapped back and forth easily.  

###Minecraft - [Developer Capes](http://www.github.com/Jadar/DeveloperCapes)

Yes, I know, more capes. Developer Capes is a library for Minecraft that allows developers to add developer/tester/anyone-you-want only capes. It reads a config file formatted in JSON, which creates groups that have a cape, and puts usernames into that group.
